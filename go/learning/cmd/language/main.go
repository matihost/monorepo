// Every Go program is made up of packages.
// Executable Programs start running in package main.

// the package has to be
// go get github.com/matihost/learning/go/cmd/language

// The library specific packages has normal name (the last directory) and can imported
//
// For more language structure go to github.com/matihost/learning/go/internal/language and
// github.com/matihost/learning/go/pkg/language

// Go implicitly imports : https://golang.org/pkg/builtin/ package with function like len, cap, make, new etc.
